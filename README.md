# Rater

Rater is a review website where student can view and post a BCIT program review.

## Why We Build Rater?

There are other review websites/platforms where students share their experience with post-secondary school or program. However, we couldn't find one specifically for BCIT student, and we wanted to build a safe space for any BCIT students to share their experience with BCIT's program anonymously. We believe that these honest reviews will help future students make critical education choices.  

## Features
